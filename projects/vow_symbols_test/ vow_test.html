        <h1>Vow of the Disciple - Symbols Test</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Destiny 2 raid 'Vow of the Disciple' features mechanics revolving around
            ~27 symbols. Being able to quickly identify these is a huge part of
            successfully completing this raid. With that in mind, this symbols test
            serves as a quick game to test your memory of these symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The symbols and responses are drawn at random and the difficulty increases in
            2 tiers, one at 5 points and the next at 10. If the timer reaches 0 or you miss an answer,
            the difficulty will reduce to its default, giving more time and fewer false options.
            Hope this helps! Happy raiding, Guardian!
        </p>
